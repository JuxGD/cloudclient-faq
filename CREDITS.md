- duplicat (developer of Cloud Client)  
Provided me a list of bugs:
  - Motionblur getting disabled when on fire
  - When hovering an item in the inventory -> Items get offset, a seemingly random black player or bow model appears under the player (replicat note: it was already in BUGS.md, but duplicat explained better)
  - Font Renderer being unable to render non-latin characters
  - UI scaling with the minecraft gui scale (not a bug, but should be changed)
