About the rpli
==============

I, replicat, made the replicense (or rpli) for FAQs, and I think it's a fair license. It reflects what I believe a FAQ license should be.

I also wanted to try and make a simple license, that is straightforward and easy to understand. You look at licenses like the LGPLv3 and you have to read not one, but TWO long licences (because LGPLv3 is an extension of the GPLv3). The normal MIT license is already kinda complicated, even the Unlicense uses unnecessarily complicated words. I understand that you have to be specific when stating the permissions others have, so that people have it very clear when it comes to what's allowed and what's not, but oftentimes they're written in such a complicated manner that it defeats the point.

You can find more versions of this license, in different formats like plain text, Markdown, etc. at the GitHub repository https://github.com/JuxGD/replicense -->
